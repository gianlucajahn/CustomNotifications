# CustomNotifications: Short Description
My first project on GitHub. A python application that lets you set up your custom desktop notification(s) with a title, a description, a sleep timer and an amount of repetitions.

# Long Description
With this first project I wanted to make something that actually comes in handy for me and maybe some others. Obviously, this is nothing special whatsoever, but I thought I had to start somewhere and if I had to, why not create something I will actually have a usage for. I looked at a couple of solutions by other users and found [TanCodes'](https://github.com/TanCodes) to be the most elegant and took inspiration from their  label- and entry-structure. I explained every part of my application to showcase an understanding of what every line of code does and why it is necessary. I tried to be very specific since I have a scientific background and I like to keep things as well-defined as possible.

# Used Modules:
- tkinter
- PIL
- plyer
- time

# How To Use

When in python, run the application. You should now be able to insert your data, 
therefore your preferred notification settings. Click the button with the label "Setup Notification" in 
the bottom middle of the application. The application will now tell you wether your input is 
of the correct format and if so, will give you a sucess message for the setup 
process of your notification.

# Used Fonts:
