# CustomNotifications: Short Description
My first project on GitHub. A python application that lets you set up your custom desktop notification(s) with a title, a description, a sleep timer and an amount of repetitions.

# Used Modules:
- tkinter
- PIL
- plyer
- time

# How To Use

When in python, run the application. You should now be able to insert your data, 
therefore your preferred notification settings. Click the button with the label "Setup Notification" in 
the bottom middle of the application. The application will now tell you wether your input is 
of the correct format and if so, will give you a sucess message for the setup 
process of your notification.
